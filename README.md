Society’s obsession with the death penalty for crimes like rape is less about justice and more about *symbolic revenge*. We’re so desperate to feel like we’ve “fixed” things that we’ll cheer for executions, thinking it somehow balances the scales. But here’s the truth: killing the perpetrator doesn’t undo the trauma. That child still has to live with the scars, the nightmares, the shattered trust. Execution isn’t justice—it’s a dramatic performance to make *us* feel better, not the survivor.  

And why do we only rage over crimes we can *see*? Mental torture—gaslighting, emotional abuse, psychological warfare—destroys people just as brutally. But because there’s no blood, no headlines, society shrugs. Trauma isn’t a competition, but we treat it like one. Newsflash: both are valid. Both deserve more than lazy, one-size-fits-all “solutions” like the death penalty.  

Let’s get one thing straight: Society’s obsession with “sexual purity” is a garbage myth invented to police bodies, not protect them. The idea that survivors of assault feel ashamed because some imaginary “purity” was “stolen”? That’s not just toxic—it’s *illogical*. Your self-respect isn’t some fragile trophy tied to what someone else did to you. It’s rooted in who you *are*—your courage, your values, how you treat others.  

We don’t blame a mugging victim for “losing” their wallet. We don’t shame someone for surviving a car crash. So why do we act like surviving violence against your body diminishes your worth? Newsflash: Your dignity isn’t stored between your legs. It’s in your integrity, your resilience, your ability to keep going even when the world tries to break you.  

If anyone should feel shame, it’s the people who *choose* to harm others—the liars, the manipulators, the ones who weaponize vulnerability. That’s a **character issue**, not a “purity” one. A person’s worth isn’t measured by what’s done *to* them, but by what they do *with* their pain. Survivors aren’t “ruined”; they’re warriors navigating a world that’s failed them.  

Society’s fixation on sexual purity isn’t just outdated—it’s dangerous. It silences survivors, excuses predators, and warps our sense of humanity. Let’s drop the medieval mindset. Your body isn’t a temple to be “defiled.” It’s yours. What happened to it doesn’t define you. What defines you is how you rise, rebuild, and refuse to let anyone else write your story.  

Stop letting ancient myths dictate modern worth. Hold your head high. The only thing that *ever* deserves shame is a rotten character—not surviving someone else’s crime.

But nah, instead of fixing the systems that create predators—like toxic masculinity, poor mental health resources, or glorified violence—we’d rather play judge, jury, and executioner. It’s easier to hashtag #DeathToMonsters than to fund therapy for survivors or teach consent in schools. We’re so warped by revenge fantasies that we ignore real healing.  

Restorative justice? Now *that’s* radical. Make perpetrators actually repair what they broke—pay for therapy, fund shelters, face survivors and hear how they’ve ruined lives. Let survivors define what justice looks like, not some ancient legal system that thinks vengeance = closure.  

And if we’re talking about “what’s natural,” let’s get real: humans evolved to protect the vulnerable, not blame them. Society’s focus on punishment over prevention, shame over support? That’s not evolution—it’s regression. We’ve got the tools to do better: education, empathy, rehab. But we’re too busy chasing symbolic wins to actually fix anything.  

Bottom line: The death penalty is a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. Real justice means rebuilding lives, not ending them. It’s time to drop the performative outrage and start doing the work. Survivors deserve more than empty gestures. They deserve a world that heals, not just punishes.
